Dash Legends is a 2D Pixelated story game that has a very long story mode, with unlockable characters, optionable quests, challanges, daily quests, and more!

-------------------------------
Dash Legends comes with a story mode that can take **1 to 1.5 days** with continuous gameplay (it's very long). After finishing, there will be more than 300 long missions
and quests waiting for you!

On the order side, in case if you finished the story mode, we made an **online mode, Dash Online!** Dash online lets you play with other players worldwide 
while grinding for gold bars, ghost keys, and money, and more. Fight with other players to claim bounty and earn money, do quests, missions, bounty hunting for more
money, gold bars, and more!

Daily Quests, Challenges, Quests, and Missions also exist on Dash Online.
**NOTE:** Your Dash Legends Story Mode progress will not be saved on Dash Online. You'll have different characters and gameplay.
